# rustici_software_cloud_v2
REST API used for SCORM Cloud integrations.

This Python package is automatically generated by the [Swagger Codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project:

- API version: 2.0
- Package version: 2.0.0
- Build package: io.swagger.codegen.languages.PythonClientCodegen

## Requirements.
Python 3.4+

## Installation
### pip
[rustici_software_cloud_v2](https://pypi.org/project/rustici_software_cloud_v2/)

```sh
pip install rustici_software_cloud_v2
```

### GitHub
[scormcloud-api-v2-client-python](https://github.com/RusticiSoftware/scormcloud-api-v2-client-python)

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/RusticiSoftware/scormcloud-api-v2-client-python.git
```

### Setuptools
```sh
python setup.py install --user
```
(or `sudo python setup.py install` to install the package for all users)

Then import the package:
```python
import rustici_software_cloud_v2
```

## Tips and Tricks
Working with headers will require calling the `WithHttpInfo` version of the function. This allows for grabbing the header directly from the response object:
```python
# Note: This code is specifically designed to not modify any existing data
dispatch_api = scorm_cloud.DispatchApi()
response = dispatch_api.update_dispatches_with_http_info(scorm_cloud.UpdateDispatchSchema(), since=datetime.utcnow().isoformat() + 'Z')
print(response[2]['X-Total-Count'])
```

## Release 2.0.X:
Check the [changelog](https://cloud.scorm.com/docs/v2/reference/changelog/) for details of what has changed.

## Sample Code
```python

        Sets the default OAuth token passed with all calls to the API.

        calls that require a different permission set will error. Either a
        new token needs to be generated with the correct scope, or the
        default access token can be reset to None. This would cause the
        request to be made with basic auth credentials (appId/ secret key)
        instead.

        Additionally, you could create a new configuration object and set
        the token on that object instead of the default access token. This
